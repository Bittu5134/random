This will be the final boss fight
Make sure to not damage the nearby area because then it wont look good.
First destroy the 3 crystals near the Alchemy Circle on top of the tall pillars
Then use the Fork to eat the biome(please go underground dont damage hte top land)
After that its just wait and watch.
make sure to watch the Boss from little far away
The rest will be done automatically
