This will be the final boss fight
Make sure not to damage the nearby area because it won't look good.
First, destroy the 3 crystals near the Alchemy Circle on top of the tall pillars
Then use the Fork to eat the biome(please go underground don't damage the top land)
After that, it's wait and watch.
make sure to watch the Boss from a little far away

The rest will be done automatically
