The atlas will lead you to the desert temple. Explode its TNT to get the fork handle.

### Tiaga Biome

You have to use a shovel to put out all the campfires in the Tiaga village

### Lush Caves

Find the Amethyst geode.

### Jungle

Fight the Kong mini-boss to clear this level

### Mountain

Kill the Ice-Illager Boss to complete this level

### Ocean

Find the Pirate Ship and kill all its Pirates.

### Mushroom island

Use Shears to remove fungus from cows

### Ice Spikes

This will be the final boss fight
Make sure to not damage the nearby area because then it wont look good.
First destroy the 3 crystals near the Alchemy Circle on top of the tall pillars
Then use the Fork to eat the biome(please go underground dont damage hte top land)
After that its just wait and watch.
make sure to watch the Boss from little far away
The rest will be done automatically
